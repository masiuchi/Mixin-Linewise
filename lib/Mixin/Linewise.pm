=head1 DESCRIPTION

It's boring to deal with opening files for IO, converting strings to
handle-like objects, and all that.  With L<Mixin::Linewise::Readers> and
L<Mixin::Linewise::Writers>, you can just write a method to handle handles, and
methods for handling strings and filenames are added for you.
